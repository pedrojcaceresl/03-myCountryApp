# My Country App

This is a project that allows you to search for countries.
- By Country
  - Here I've implemented a suggestion box feature. 
- By Region
- By Capital City
- Also allows you to see the detail of the country you have selected.

I made this project to practice some important angular concepts. I used the angular routes, modules, components, activated routes, some RxJS operators, Observables, Subjects, external API consumption through services, interfaces, bootstrap, and animateCSS, good practices and more.

The demo of the app is available here: https://micountryapp.netlify.app/

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.3.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
